In this Project, Atmega32 MicroController was used with internal Frequency 8Mhz.
Measured the distance using the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04. 
LCD dispalyed the distance.
The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture
model as follow:
1- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) 
2- MicroController Abstraction Layer (MCAL)
All Driver Used are implemented by user such as:
1- GPIO Drivers
2- ICU Drive
3- LCD Drive
4- Ultrasonic Driver 
5- Macros Drivers
6- Standard types.
Project was tested on Proteus and Applying of ATmega32
