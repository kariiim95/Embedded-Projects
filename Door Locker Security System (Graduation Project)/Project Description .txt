Implement the Door Locker Security System to unlock a door using a password.
with the specifications listed below:
1) Use two ATmega32 Microcontrollers with frequency 8Mhz.
2) The project should be design and implemented based on the layered architecture
model as follow:

ℳc1 → HMI_ECU (Human Machine Interface) with 2x16 LCD and 4x4 keypad.
ℳc2 → Control_ECU with EEPROM, Buzzer, and Dc-Motor

3)HMI_ECU is just responsible interaction with the user just take inputs through keypad and display
messages on the LCD.
4)CONTROL_ECU is responsible for all the processing and decisions in the system like password
checking, open the door and activate the system alarm.


5)System Sequence:

Step1 – Create a System Password
Step2 - Main Options (Choose Step 3 or Step 4) 

Step 3 - Open Door +
Step 4 - Change Password -
Step 5 - HMI_ECU should send the Password to the Control_ECU and it should compare it
	with the one saved in the EEPROM.
