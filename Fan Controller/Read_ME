The Project concept is to control fan according to sensed temperature from Sensor.
The LM35 Temp. Sensor will continuous give analog output corresponding to temperature value. 
These analog signals will be converted to digital values by ADC drivers.
According to corresponding value of Temp. the motor will rotate with diver speed and direction.
Final value will be passed to LCD Drivers.
Project Applied Lay Architecture model such as: APP, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and Microcontroller Abstraction Layer (MCAL). 
Drivers Implemented by User:
HAL Drivers: LCD Driver , Sensor Driver , DC-motor Driver 
MCAL Drivers: GPIO Drivers, ADC Drivers, PWM Drivers.
